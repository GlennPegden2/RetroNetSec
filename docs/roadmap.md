- Get DOS Doom running over IPX between containers (prove we can route ethernet) 
- Replicate Ping of Death between hosts
- Replicate RTM work
- Wiz onto a mail server (on RTM worm)
- Connect out onto physical (needed for hardware interfacing?)
- Replicate some of the Stok/Ledbeater ansi stuff from DefCon31
- Get an old school fido-node BBS up
- Simulate a US Phone trunk
- Phreak Box (tone loc etc) ... can we either similate or connected out onto POTS?
