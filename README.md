# RetroNetSec
A fully fledge network of yester-year to teach long forgotten security techniques

NOT a CTF - A learning platform, play with ancient vulns for ancient systems

Ideally all "open" (or automated to snaffle the less open bits off archive.org) and containerised as much as possible so anyone can contribute and anyone can just spin up the bits they are interested in.
Interoperatibility with  real hardware?

Not just TCP/IP based networking (IPX, LanMan, DecNET, AppleTalk etc)
